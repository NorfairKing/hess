# mail-spider

## Goals

The long-term goals of this project is to inform people on how to make sure that their email-address cannot be scraped while still being visible to human users.

In short term:
- Find as many valid email-addresses in as small a wall-clock time as possible.
- Add modules for countering different obfuscation methods.


Wanted arguments:
- flags for modules to turn on
- how much resources to use: cores, etc...


## Design considerations

The web is huge.
There is no need to be very precise.
